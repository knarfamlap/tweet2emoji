## Introduction

Tweet2Emoji is a emoji classifier. It takes your tweets and assigns an appropriate emoji. Given the text of a tweet, our machine learning model can predict the most likely assosiated emoji's. We framed the problem as multi-class classification problem. With the dataset in used, we identified the 10 most commonly used emojis. We decided to used **Logistic Regression**, **Support Vector Machines(SVM)**, and **Naive Bayes** to see which classifier preforms the best. The current baseline approach (and the approach used the web app [here](Tweet2Emoji](https://tweet02emoji.herokuapp.com/)) is Logistic Regression. We then evaluate the model using accuracy and F1 score.
